The Open Source release generated an explosion of community interest and support, resulting in ports to other platforms and significant language changes. Swift version 3, which reflects the results of much of this work, was released in September of 2016, bringing with it some significant refinements to the core language and a new package manager.

Swift is a multi-paradigm language, supporting imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming styles. The language is strongly typed but has extensive support for type inference and substantial tooling available in XCode to identify and in some cases automatically fix common programming errors. Swift uses a memory management strategy called automatic reference counting (ARC), freeing programmers from the tedium of manually managing memory allocation. This combination of strong typing, maximal type inference, automatic reference counting (ARC), and excellent tooling results in an experience that can be described as ""the Macintosh of programming languages"".

This talk will present some of the history of the development of Swift with emphasis on how the Open Source release of the language kick-started activity, review the basic syntax of Swift (with comparisons to similar languages that attendees may be more familiar with), and describe what tools are available to help learn the language, including XCode, the Swift REPL available from XCode, and the new Swift Playgrounds for iPad that debuted with Swift 3 and iOS10. After attending this talk, an attendee with no previous Swift experience will understand exactly why they should be excited about this relatively new programming language and be up to date on exactly what they need to do to dive into Swift coding for themselves.

Authors get their modules tested on hundreds of O/S and Perl platform combinations. Setting up and managing a machine dedicated to testing can be difficult, however, even a virtual machine requires a lot of extra work to keep running. Docker (containers in general) provide an alternative: all it requires is the shared libraries for Perl and a way to import CPAN modules for tesing. The ability to manage resources and suspend/restart the containers also makes this nice for background work on larger systems.

This talk discusses the basics of setting up the CPAN testers code in a docker container and running the test cycle for in-house testing or as part of the general tester's network."

RSI, a class keyword, and more.

Plus annotations now let you make all sorts of trouble, and the tooling to
transpile to Olde JS is mostly comprehensible and no longer replaced by
something completely different every two weeks.

It will reduce inline manual format instructions by a structured HoH bulk input. Kangiten produces the document in a two stage way.   Creation of structure first than filling the content. The two way method will help to reuse the structure in similar needs and recycle the structure to meet minor variation.

During implementation of a billing solution for Advertising Agency, we have requirements to produce PDF documents with six different structures and the document structure shared by 3 different legal entities with minor variations. It has the usual Estimate – Purchase Order -> Invoice with Detail, Rate, Qty and Amount with varied additional columns for Print Media and A/V works. Mainly we looked for a PDF library with:

1.        Ability to tailor build the document
2.        A module that gives production control in pixel level
3.        Flexible options to set page properties
4.        Option to implement images/signatures
5.        Position control to handle page continuation

After a lengthy search, we finally zeroed in PDF-Reuse module. It did not have user friendly function wraps for graphical output, but it offered a developer friendly core functions to control the graphical output in a pixel level. It helped to wrap our custom functions to handle in generic way.

Map to Reuse, Reduce & Recycle

One of PDF:: Reuse’s main advantage is that it can take an existing PDF - something that our designers can create with their standard PDF tools and then all we have to do is add the various content details to it. The feature of reusing the existing PDF and writing content over that, helped to reuse the existing legal entity letter pads in specific company document production.  It's avoided manual graphic production work.

Instead of line by line manual instruction to write and format, we used a structured bulk input to create structure with format need and fill the content.  The PDF::Reuse core function mapped to input data.

The document classified into three major parts:

1.        The page layout and page background
2.        Header
3.        Content

Each input will take the communication in HoH structure.

A simple structure to produce one line seems like:

    # Data structure input for produce one liner output
    # base structure
    my $print_data = {
        0 => {
            left_xaxis  => 250,     # print start x position
            line_height => 25,
            # column definition
            header => {
                # define the first (and only) column
                0 => {
                    font      => 'Helvetica-Bold',
                    font_size => 12,
                },
            },
            # insert the data
            data => [['Production Estimate']],
        },
     };

The same structure can be reused to similar needs and adjusted to minor variations and duplicated to continuous need.  Based on the structure it will produce single row & multiple row contents.  It's continuously evolved to meet real time needs. Some of the features like  header continuation to new pages,  table header to new pages, auto compress the document size  added incrementally.

Started from  billing solution, now it helps in many of our PDF document productions needs. Now it's available in public.

https://github.com/WebstarsCG/Kangiten-PDF-Writer

In this talk, I will share the tools inner components,  existing use cases and a short hands-on implementation on structured way of document generation to achieve Reuse Structure, Reduce Code & Development Time  & Recycle the structures to meet variations.

It will be debuting with its first public release on CPAN on the day of the talk! Folks, this is conference-driven development at its finest.

Previous years' RapidApp talks have also involved day-of, first-time releases of demo applications, but this year is different in that Rapi::Blog is first and foremost a real application and is designed for real-world use. 

Another blog?!?? Yep. And, like the countless other devs that came before me - who broke-down and said ""screw it, I'll just write my own blog"" - I went down the rabbit hole because I wanted some set of features and functionality that I couldn't find in other platforms. Everyone has different priorities, but for me, the two main factors were:

1. Truer abstraction and separation between the front-end ""theme"" and the backend
2. Leveraging the features and flexibility of RapidApp 

Rapi::Blog introduces a new ""scaffold"" pattern which consists of a file structure of template-driven, pure HTML/CSS documents that are able to represent the view and layout for a given site using a straightforward but comprehensive API of template directives. The intent is to reduce the translation effort needed to convert a static, font-end only html site (such as a bootstrap site/template) to be driven from dynamic, backend models. The blog pattern emerges from a content model (i.e. posts, comments, etc, standard blog features) and a scaffold of html templates, css and images which accesses it.

Since it's powered by RapidApp, the initialization of the storage model is all automatic and requires virtually nothing for a new site/instance (unless you want to customize the model, which you can). In this way, a Rapi::Blog installation is able to consist of nothing but a scaffold and a place to store data. It is then the scaffold that can be extended, customized and adapted to create all kinds layouts, designs and scenarios. That said, Rapi::Blog will also ship with a fully-working vanilla-design scaffold needed to function as a blog.

If you want to try another blog with maximalist features but minimalist effort, or, if you just want to see my/RapidApp's take on the blog question, this talk is for you. Just like previous RapidApp talks, this one will consist of all live-running, real-time demos (which you can run yourself), and should be a lot of fun.

This software can sometimes be improved with programming best practices. However, programming best practices do not help with data analysis software, the code that transforms the raw experimental data into digestible results, tables, and figures. Often, the most important results are not immediately obvious, only emerging after a period of exploratory analysis. This highly dynamic process involves pruning and sharpening, abandoning and starting fresh, and returning to a previously abandoned approach. Multiple lines of analysis from one stage serve as the starting point of the next. Test suites are a premature optimization, yet bugs sneak in and are discovered only in later stages. Over the last few years I have developed a modulino-based approach for managing this unusual set of challenges and constraints. In this talk, I will show the many inefficient approaches scientists use, how conventional software practices don't help, and how Perl's quirks make it easy to solve this problem with just a little bit of creativity and discipline."

Programmers aren’t to blame, as our programming languages, libraries, and databases provide little or no support for understanding user-perceived characters. Many systems disagree on the basic units of characters, some use code points, others use code units, and others still operate on individual bytes by default. This frequently leads to products with a poor experience in some users’ languages, especially written languages that use grapheme clusters, sequences of code points that compose a single user-perceived character. With the rise in global emoji usage and the rapid evolution of standard emoji sequences, this problem is increasingly experienced by users worldwide, regardless of their language.

This session will cover:
• Extended grapheme clusters and emoji sequences
• Programming with these user-perceived characters
• Data input, parsing, analysis, formatting, and output

With Moose, simple classes can be created without writing any subroutines, and complex classes can be simplified. Moose’s features include a powerful attribute declaration system, type constraints and coercions, method modifiers (“before”, “after”, and “around”), a role system (like mixins on steroids), and more. Moose also has a vibrant ecosystem of extensions as seen in the variety of MooseX:: modules on CPAN.

This course covers Moose’s core features, goes in depth on many of them, and explores some of the more powerful MooseX:: modules available on CPAN.

This is a hands-on course. Each lecture section is followed by a hands-on exercise section where you put what you’ve just learned into practice. The instructor will work with each student individually as needed to help you get the most from these exercises.

This class is aimed at Perl programmers who understand object-oriented programming and want to learn how to do it with Moose. It is not suitable for Perl beginners or for people without any OO experience. OO experience in other languages besides Perl is sufficient, as long as you also have a good grasp of Perl syntax, particularly method call syntax.

Students are expected to bring a laptop with a recent version of Perl and the editor of their choice. You will also be expected to clone the class’s git repository in order to obtain a copy of the class slides and exercises.

Mark Jason Dominus,mjd,,http://perl.plover.com/,,,Half Day Tutorial,6,2017-06-22,14:00,Madison B,Tutorial,Intermediate,Advanced Parsing Techniques for Perl,"Parsing is the task of analyzing unstructured inputs, such as character strings, and transforming them into structured data, such as databases or hierarchies. Nearly every program has to parse input. Perl provides some built-in operators for parsing, but they go only so far. And although CPAN contains several excellent parsing modules, most are fundamentally limited.

In this class, we will see how to build a parsing system that is unlimited in extent. The basic idea is to construct modular tools that can assemble simple parsers into more complex ones. When complex parsers are built from simple components, parsing code is powerful, flexible, and maintainable. Parsers are written directly in Perl, not in a separate language. Some tools are generic, and are useful in building nearly any parser, but we'll also see how to build special-purpose parser-constructing tools as we need them to solve parsing problems that are specific to an application. Topics will include:

*  Building lexers and emulating Perl's '<FH>' operator
*  Very simple parsers
*  Writing functions to combining simple parsers into more complex ones
*  Recursive descent
*  Case study: parsing regular expressions
*  Case study: parsing outlines and trees
*  Parsers that diagnose and recover from erroneous input
*  Backtracking
*  Operator overloading

languages used in the Unix sysadmin community, such as C, Bourne shell, awk, and sed. Perl programmers tend to come from
that community, or to have been trained by people who did.

Perhaps you've heard the joke that a dedicated Fortran programmer can write Fortran programs in any language. But Perl programmers have been writing C programs in Perl for years without realizing it. This class will show you how to effectively use some of Perl's most powerful features to do
organize your programs more powerfully and effectively.

I've raided the techniques of the Lisp and functional programming communities and come back with all the loot I can carry, techniques for increasing modularity and interoperability on large projects.

We'll take recursion to the next level and see how to build powerful recursive functions for managing hierarchical data. We'll see how callbacks, usually relegated to GUI programming, can be used to increase modularity in your library functions, so that they can be used in ways you didn't expect, by programmers years later, without anyone having to change or even look at your code. We'll look in detail at how to provide 'function factories' that manufacture, on demand, the library functions that the user needs. We'll see how objects based on anonymous functions can be used to get around some of the limitations of Perl's built in OOP system. We'll see how to make your own filehandle-like objects that generate data on demand.
